      <p>Since PowerCharts is based on FusionCharts v3 framework, it utilizes most of the features provided by the parent v3 suite itself. In this section of documentation, we'll cover some basic grounds on features provided by FusionCharts v3 framework. These features apply to most of the charts in PowerCharts v3 too. </p>
      <p>Throughout this section, we've used the Column 2D, Column 3D and Pie 3D charts from FusionCharts v3 suite to explain generic features provided by FusionCharts v3 framework. These features can be applied to each of the PowerCharts charts as well. <br />
        <br />
        The Column 2D, Column 3D and Pie 3D charts discussed in this section are NOT part of PowerCharts v3. But these being the simplest   charts in the entire FusionCharts suite,  things will be much easier for   you to grasp when explained in perspective of these charts. Once you're   a pro with the basics, you can easily apply the same concepts to the   charts you desire to use.          <br />
        <br />
        Also, in this section, we've synonymously used the terms FusionCharts v3 and PowerCharts v3. </span></p>
